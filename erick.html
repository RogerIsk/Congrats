      <p>
        While I was learning 3D modeling, I had an idea to create a store on
        Etsy to sell digital props for 3D printers. This would allow me to
        continue practicing my skills. I was pleasantly surprised by the success
        of my store, as I was able to sell more than I had anticipated. However,
        due to personal reasons, I had to close the store in the end.

      <h2>How to stay Humble</h2>

        Staying humble is essential, especially in the face of success or
        recognition. One effective way to maintain humility is to continuously
        remind oneself of the journey that led to accomplishments. Reflecting on
        the challenges overcome, the support received from others, and the room
        for growth ahead can help ground achievements in perspective.
        Additionally, surrounding oneself with honest and constructive feedback
        from peers, mentors, and loved ones can serve as a reality check,
        keeping ego in check and fostering a mindset of continuous improvement.
        It's also crucial to acknowledge that success is often a team effort,
        attributing credit where it's due and expressing gratitude towards those
        who have contributed to one's journey. Lastly, staying connected to
        one's values and remaining open to learning from others' experiences can
        help cultivate a humble demeanor, reminding oneself that there is always
        more to learn and accomplish.
